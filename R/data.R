#'
#' Participants made probability judgments of the format: “What is the probability that the weather is \[X\] on a random day in England?". Various weather events were used, and the queries included both marginal events, conditional events, conjunctions, and disjunctions. The total set of 20 unique queries formed a block within which the presentation order was randomized for each participant. The experiment consisted of three blocks, so that all participants responded to each unique query three times.

#' Data from Experiment 2a in \insertCite{spicer2022PerceptualCognitiveJudgments;textual}{samplrData}
#'
#' Cognitive judgments. Participants answered questions about commonly experienced values. Unlike in Experiment 2, participants viewed each question multiple times, comparing each against both a low (25.5) and high (75.5) comparison value to create 40 trial cases. As in Experiment 1, decisions were requested on all trials, but only 30% of trials were randomly selected to include a direct estimate.
