#' Data from Experiment 1 in \insertCite{zhu2020BayesianSamplerGeneric;textual}{samplrData}
#'
#' Participants made probability judgments of the format: “What is the probability that the weather is \[X\] on a random day in England?". Various weather events were used, and the queries included both marginal events, conditional events, conjunctions, and disjunctions. The total set of 20 unique queries formed a block within which the presentation order was randomized for each participant. The experiment consisted of three blocks, so that all participants responded to each unique query three times.

#' Participants made probability judgments about future hypothetical events, of the format: “What is the probability that there will be an early UK general election AND the UK economy will recover this year?". The experiment consisted of three blocks, so that all participants responded to each unique query three times.

#' Participants (from Prolific) estimated the frequencies of different 3-card combinations in a 52 card deck and 3-ball combinations in a 52 ball urn (mathematically identical questions). They also answered surveys on poker playing habits and gamblers fallacy questionnaire.
